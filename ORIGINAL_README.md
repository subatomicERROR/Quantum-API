# Quantum-API

Quantum-API is a fast and scalable API built with FastAPI and Quantum computing principles, leveraging PennyLane for quantum-enhanced decision making. This API exposes quantum-powered endpoints to help make intelligent, data-driven decisions using quantum insights.

## Features

- Quantum-powered decision-making using **PennyLane**'s quantum circuits.
- FastAPI-powered REST API endpoints for easy interaction.
- Real-time decision generation based on quantum computations.
- Seamless integration for scalable AI and machine learning applications.

## Project Structure

├── app.py              # The main FastAPI application file
├── main.py             # Contains the quantum decision-making logic

```

## Requirements

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Node.js** (for frontend development, if applicable)

### Python Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Node.js Dependencies (If Running with Frontend)

For frontend development (if applicable), make sure Node.js is installed. You can install the necessary packages by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Backend (FastAPI)

To start the FastAPI backend server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

This will start the FastAPI server on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend (Optional)

If you have a frontend that communicates with the API, you can run it by using the following command (make sure you've run `npm install` beforehand):

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend development server, usually on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing the API

Once the backend is running, you can test the API with tools like **Postman** or **cURL**.

### Example cURL Request

To test the `/quantum-ai/predict` endpoint, you can run:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:5000/quantum-ai/predict' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "input_data": "your_data_here"
}'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "quantum_result": 0.0,
  "decision": "Explore alternative paths based on quantum insight."
}
```
